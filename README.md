After knowing that Princeton University is retiring its Static Web Hosting (SWH) system, I started searching for alternative platforms for hosting my personal website. I decided to use GitHub as it's free, gives me the flexibility I need, and others can reuse it more easily.

New website address: https://mshahrad.github.io , Old website address: http://www.princeton.edu/~mshahrad

The base for my website is an open source template from HTML5 UP (https://html5up.net). So feel free to reuse my modified version or visit their website for other nice templates.


Some Performance Comparison 

After I moved my website from the university server to GitHub Pages, I did some performance profiling using the Pingdom tool (https://tools.pingdom.com).
